In this workout, we analyze a dataset containing information about shots attempted and successfully made by 5 players on a professional NBA team -- the Golden State Warriors. With information about the in-game activity of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry, we prepare the given dataset, generate visualizations including shot charts (and optionally others, as preferred), and write a final report from the point of view of a sports media reporter about the shooting statistics of the five GSW players.
